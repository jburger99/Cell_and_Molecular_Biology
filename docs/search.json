Shorter chains reduce the likelihood of the hydrocarbon tails to interact with each other. Cis-double bonded hydrocarbon chains produce kinks that make them more difficult to pack together. However, cis-double bonded unsaturated hydrocarbons produce a thinner bilayer than saturated hydrocarbons.\nThe hydroxyl group of xholesterol interacts with the polar heads of phospholipids causing the rigid, platelike steroid rings to interact with and partially immobilize those sections of the hydrocarbon chains. This immobilization also vauses the bilayer to be less permiable to small water-soluble molecules by making it less deformable.\nBacterial membranes tend to be composed of a singular phospholipid and no cholesterol. Conversely, animal cells can contain multiple phospholipids as well as cholesterol."
