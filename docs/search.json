However, cis-double bonded unsaturated hydrocarbons produce a thinner bilayer than saturated hydrocarbons.\nThe hydroxyl group of cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of phospholipids causing the rigid, platelike steroid rings to interact with and partially immobilize those sections of the hydrocarbon chains.

The do this using extra long polysaccharides side chains that bind to the signal protein.\nIn the case of neurotransmitters, the binding affinity of the transmitter to it receptor is low so that it can dissociate from the receptor quickly to rapidly terminate a response.

    "text": "Cyclic-AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase (PKA)\nCyclic-AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase (PKA), in an inactive state, is made up of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits (also called A-kinases) that form a complex. The binding of cAMP causes the dissociation of the regulatory subunits by changing their conformation. This activates the PKA.\nAn A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) located around the nucleus of a heart cell binds both PKA and phosphodiesterase that hyrdrolyzes cAMP. In an unstimulated cell the phospgodesterase keeps the cAMP concentration low to keep the PKA inactive. In a simulated cell the cAMP concentration is rapidly elevated activating the PKA. The PKA in turn activates the bound phosphodiesterase leading to a decrease in the cAMP concentration. This allows for a strong, brief, local pulse of PKA activity as apposed to a long, weak, general period of PKA activity.\nCyclic AMP response element or CRE is a short DNA sequence found in the gene regulatory region of many cAMP activated genes. CRE-binding protein (CREB) recognizes the CRE. When PKA is activated by cAMP, it phosphorylates CREB on a single serine. The phosphorylated CREB then recruits CREB-binding protein (CBP) which stimulates the reanscription of the targeted genes."
