However, cis-double bonded unsaturated hydrocarbons produce a thinner bilayer than saturated hydrocarbons.\nThe hydroxyl group of cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of phospholipids causing the rigid, platelike steroid rings to interact with and partially immobilize those sections of the hydrocarbon chains.

The do this using extra long polysaccharides side chains that bind to the signal protein.\nIn the case of neurotransmitters, the binding affinity of the transmitter to it receptor is low so that it can dissociate from the receptor quickly to rapidly terminate a response.
