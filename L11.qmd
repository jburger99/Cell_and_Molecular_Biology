## Signaling through G-protein-coupled Cell-surface…

There are more than 700 GPCRs in humans. 

A single ligand can activate multiple GCPRs.

A GPCR consits of a single polypeptide chain threaded seven times across the cell membrane. All GPCRs use G proteins to relay signals to cell interior.

## Trimeric G proteins relay signals from GPCRs

The three subunits of a trimeric G protein are the $\alpha$ subunit, the $\beta$ subunit, and the $\gamma$ subunit. 

The $\alpha$ subunit is bound to a GDP when the G protein is inactive. 

When the G protein is activated the $\alpha$ subunit releases its bound GDP and binds to a GTP. The $\alpha$ subunit is a GTPase and hydrolyzes its bound GTP. When the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to a GDP the G protein becomes inactive. 

The $\beta$ and $\gamma$ subunits form a $\beta \gamma$ subunit. In most cases the conformational change that occurs upon the activation of the G protein dissociates the $\alpha$ subunit from the $\beta \gamma$ complex. In some situations, however, the $\alpha$ subunit remains associated with the $\beta \gamma$ complex.

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) act as $\alpha$-subunit-specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and they help shutoff G protein mediated responses.

## Some G proteins regulate…

Adenylyl cyclase is a membrane bound enzyme that synthesizes cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP is rapidly and continuously destroyed by cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. 

To increase the concentration of cAMP in a cell, extracellular singaling molecules increase the activity of adenylyl cyclase against a background of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. 

To control cAMP activity GPCRs use G$_s$ and G$_i$. Stimulatory G protein or G$_s$ is used to increase cAMP activity. To decrease cAMP activity Inhibatory G protein or G$_i$ is used.

Cholera toxin increase cAMP activity by modifying the $\alpha$ subunit of G$_s$ by transferring ADP ribose from intracellular NAD$^+$. The ADP ribose prevents the $\alpha$ subunit from hydrolyzing its bound GTP, causing adenylyl cyclase to be constantly active. The prolonged elevation of cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells causes an increase of water and Cl$^-$ in the gut leading to severe diarrhea. 

Pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of the $\alpha$ subuint of G$_i$. This prevents G$_i$ from interacting with receptors resulting in the G protein reaining bound to its GDP, diabling its ability to regualte its target proteins.

## Cyclic-AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase (PKA)

Cyclic-AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase (PKA), in an inactive state, is made up of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits (also called A-kinases) that form a complex. The binding of cAMP causes the dissociation of the regulatory subunits by changing their conformation. This activates the PKA.

An A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) located around the nucleus of a heart cell binds both PKA and phosphodiesterase that hyrdrolyzes cAMP. In an unstimulated cell the phospgodesterase keeps the cAMP concentration low to keep the PKA inactive. In a simulated cell the cAMP concentration is rapidly elevated activating the PKA. The PKA in turn activates the bound phosphodiesterase leading to a decrease in the cAMP concentration. This allows for a strong, brief, local pulse of PKA activity as apposed to a long, weak, general period of PKA activity. 

Cyclic AMP response element or CRE is a short DNA sequence found in the gene regulatory region of many cAMP activated genes. CRE-binding protein (CREB) recognizes the CRE. When PKA is activated by cAMP, it phosphorylates CREB on a single serine. The phosphorylated CREB then recruits CREB-binding protein (CBP) which stimulates the reanscription of the targeted genes.

## Some G Proteins Activate an Inositol…

PIP$_2$ is present in small amounts in the inner hlaf og the plasma membrane bilayer. 

G$_q$ activates phospholipase C-$\_beta$ (PLC$\beta$) a membrane bound enzyme that is often activated to extert the effects of GPCRs. G$_q$ activates PLC$\beta$ in a similar way to G$_s$ activating adenylyl cyclase. PLC$\beta$ cleaves PIP$_2$ into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP$_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).

IP$_3$ acts as a small intracellular mediator. It opens IP$_3$-gated Ca$^+{^2}$ channels (also called PIP$_3$ receptors) on the ER to release Ca$^+{^2}$ found in the ER into the cytosol. This quickly increases the Ca$^+{^2}$ concentration of the cytosol.

DAG also acts as a small intracellular mediator. DAG, however, remains embedded in the plasma membrane where it has several potential roles. 

- DAG can be cleaved to release arachidonic acid that can act as a signal molecule or be used to synthesize eicosanoids. Eicosanoids can serve many biological roles particularly in the pain and inflammatory responses. 

- DAG can activate the Ca$^+{^2}$ dependent serine/threonine protein kinase called protein kinase C (PKC). 

## Ca2+ Functions as a Ubiquitous Intracellular Mediator

Ca$^+{^2}$ from the ER enters the cytosol either through PIP$_3$ receptors or ryanodine receptors. Ryanodine receptors are activated by Ca$^+{^2}$ binding and thereby amplifying the Ca$^+{^2}$ signal. 

All eukaryotic cells have Ca$^+{^2}$-pumps that use energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump Ca$^+{^2}$ out of the cytosol. Some cells also have additional Ca$^+{^2}$ transport proteins in their plasma membrane to pair the efflux of Ca$^+{^2}$ with the influx of Na$^+$.

## Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases…

Calmodulin consists of a highly conserved single polypeptide chain with four high-affinity Ca$^+{^2}$-binding sites. Calmodulin under goes a conformational change when Ca$^+{^2}$ binding occurs. Two or more Ca$^+{^2}$ must bind to calmodulin for it to adopt its active conformation. A tenfold increase in Ca$^+{^2}$ typically causes a fifty fold increase in calmodulin activity. 

Ca$^+{^2}$/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaM-kinases) can act as a molecular memory device because after they are activated by Ca$^+{^2}$/calmodulin they remain active after the Ca$^+{^2}$ signal has decayed. 

## Some G proteins Directly Regulate Ion Channels

Activation of muscarinic receptors lead to reduced contractility of heart muscle because they activate G$_i$ proteins. The $\alpha$ subunit of the G$_i$ inhibits adenylyl cylcase. The $\beta\gamma$ complex bind to K$^+$ channels keeping them open, this makes it harder to depolarize the cell ans contributes to the inhibatory effect of acetylcholine on the heart.

## GPCR Desensitization depends…

The three forms of GPCR desnsitization are:

1. Receptor inactivation

2. Receptor sequestration

3. Receptor down-regulation

GPCR kinases (GRKs) play a role in GPCR desensitization by phosphorylation. 

Phosphorylated GPCRs bind with a high affinity to arrestins that can prevent the activation of the receptor by G proteins. Arrestins can alo serve as an adaptor protein to help couple the receptor tho clathrin-dependent machinery indcuing receptor-mediated endocytosis.
