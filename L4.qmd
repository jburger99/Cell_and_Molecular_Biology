### The Cell Regulates the Catalytic...

#### Active Protein Regulation

Active regulation is when regulatory molecules stimulate enzyme activity rather than shutting them down.

Cells can actively control regulate proteins by:

-   regulating the expression of the gene that encodes that enzyme

-   confining sets of enzymes to particular sub-cellular compartments enclosed by distinct membranes

-   covalently modifying enzymes

1.  Phosphorylation (MOST COMMON)

2.  acetylation

3.  Methylation

4.  Ubiquitination

5.  sumoylation

6.  palmitoylation

etc.

-   destroying proteins by targeted proteolysis

-   reversible change in the activity of an enzyme in response to specific small molecules it encounters

#### Negative Protein Regulation

Feedback Inhibition: a product produced late in a reaction pathway inhibits an enzyme that acts earlier in the pathway.

Negative regulation is when an enzyme is prevented from activating.

### Allosteric enzymes have two or more...

Allosteric regulation is regulation that occurs when a molecule binds to the regulatory site of a enzyme causing its confirmation to change blocking or enhancing the active site.

Regulatory site: binding site for a regulatory molecule

Active site: binding site for substrates

### Many changes in proteins are driven...

Phosphorylation is a covalent modification of a enzyme where a phosphate group is added to the protein. The ways that phosphorylation can affect activity of a protein are:

-   by attracting a cluster of positively amino acid side chains causing a major confirmation change.

-   forming part of a structure that the binding sites of other proteins (adaptor proteins) recognize.

-   masking binding sites for protein-protein interactions

One third of all proteins in mammalian cells are thought to be phosphorylated at a given time. A protein can be phosphorylated in multiple places but a polyphosphate chain cannot be formed.

### A Eukaryotic Cell Contains a large...

Protein phosphorylation involves the enzyme-catalyzed transfer of the terminal phosphate of an ATP molecule to the hydroxyl group on a serine, theonine, or tyrosine side chain of the protein. Phosphorylation is considered an unidirectional reaction because of the large amount of free energy released when the phosphate-phosphate bond is broken to convert ATP to ADP. Protein kinases catalyse the phosphorylation reaction. A protein phosphatase catalyzes the reverse reaction.
