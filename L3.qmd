### Purpose of the Proteasome

1.  Destroy misfolded, partially folded, or damaged proteins

2.  Destroy "unwanted" proteins (regulated destruction) e.g. cyclins

3.  Created peptides for presentation to the immune system

### New Proteins

New proteins can:

-   fold properly without help

-   fold properly with help from chaperons

-   improperly fold and be destroyed by the proteasome

Failure of these three outcomes can lead to protein aggregates.

### Proteasome Structure

#### 20s Core

A hollow tube with protease active sites. Proteins must be fed through the core to be degraded. The core is made up of 4 rings each made up of 7 subunits.

#### 19s Caps

Each cap is an ATP-unfoldase with Ubiquitin binding sites and deubiquitinases (Ubiquitin hydrolase). Each cap has six subunits.

The total proteasome is a 26s proteasome.

### Degrons

Degrons are degradation signals on or in protein substrates that bind to the E3 ligase.

N-end Rule:

-   N-termius or cleavage of the N-terminus contains certain amino acids that act as a degrons.
