### Noncovalent Interactions

#### Electrostatic attractions

Result from the attractive forces between oppositely charged atoms. Form between permanent dipoles.

#### Hydrogen bonds

The partial sharing of an electropostive hydrogen atom between two negatively charged atoms. Strongest when a straight line can be drawn between the three atoms.

#### van der Waals attractions

A weak attraction created by flickering dipoles. Flickering dipoles are the result of the fluctuations in the electron cloud around an atom.

#### Hydrophobic force

Caused by the hydrogen-bonded water network pushing non-polar molecules out.

### Noncovalent bonds specify both the precise shape of a macromolecule and its binding to other molecules

Noncovalent interactions cooperate to fold macromolecules into unique shapes. Additionally they can add up to create attractions between two molecules.

### Enzymes

#### Enzymes Lower the barriers that block chemical reactions

Energetically favorable reactions are reactions that results in a "downhill" direction. Ergo, to be energetically favorable a reaction must result in a loss of free energy.

##### Free energy

Energy that can be harnessed to do work or drive a chemical reaction

$\Delta$H = $\Delta$G = T$\Delta$S

##### Basic enzyme structure

Enzymes are proteins that bind tightly to one or more molecules called substrates, and hold them in a way that reduces activation energy for a chemical reaction acting as catalysts. Catalysts are any substance that an lower the activation energy of a reaction and increase the speed of the reaction.

#### How Enzymes find their substrates

Enzymes are slow moving compared to their substrates and bind to them when collisions occur. All molecules are moved through three types of motion:

-   Translation motion (Diffusion): the movement of from one place to another

-   Vibration

-   Rotation

Motion in the system is cause by heat energy. Collisions between molecules cause them to change direction, this change in direction is called $random$ $walk.$ Net distance of a molecule is proportional to the square root of the time involved.

\sqrt{time}
$$ Enzymes bind to their substrates through complementary charges at the bind regions.

### Free Energy Changes

#### The concentration of reactants influences the free-energy change and a

reaction's direction

$\Delta$G = $\Delta$G$^\circ$ + RT ln K

$\Delta$G$^\circ$:

-   standard $\Delta$G

-   1 mol reactants

-   1 mol products

-   25$^\circ$

R:

-   gas constant

T:

-   Temperature Kelvin

K:

-   Equilibrium ratio

-   products / reactants

Simplified equation:

$\Delta$G = $\Delta$G$^\circ$ + 1.42 log(\[P\]/\[R\])

-   assumes temp of 37$^\circ$f

$\Delta$G = G$_\text{products}$ - G$_\text{reactants}$

$\Delta$G \< 0: Spontaneous (exergonic) $\Delta$G \> 0: Non-spontaneous (endorgonic) $\Delta$G = 0: Equilibrium

Enzymes lower the E$_\text{a}$ (activation energy)

#### For sequential reactions, $\Delta$G values are additive
